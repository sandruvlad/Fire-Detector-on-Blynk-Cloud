# Fire-Detector-on-Blynk-Cloud
Fire detector and air monitoring


The code below will help the integration of 2 IoT Sensors to the Blynk Cloud Services (desktop and mobile) for demonstration purposes. Every trigger will report to the Arduino IDE via Serial Monitor and to the cloud via WIFI. 

Check Blynk to see Documentation for other services or paid options. I will limit the user to 3 devices and any visualisation or data post-processing will not be available without a subscription.
